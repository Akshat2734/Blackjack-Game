**Blackjack Game Program Description:**

This program is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. In Blackjack, players aim to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game is played against a dealer, who also attempts to achieve the highest hand value without going over 21.

**Features:**

1. **User Interaction:** The program starts by asking the user if they want to play a game of Blackjack. The user responds with either "yes" or "no".

2. **Card Drawing:** If the user chooses to play, the program deals two cards to the player and one card to the dealer. The cards are drawn randomly from a standard deck of 52 cards, which includes cards with values ranging from 1 to 11.

3. **Game Loop:** After the initial deal, the program enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the player if they want to draw another card or stand. The player can choose to draw a card (hit) or end their turn (stand). If the player chooses to draw a card, a new card is added to their hand.

4. **Winning Condition:** Once the player stands, the dealer draws cards until their hand value is 17 or higher. The program then compares the total hand values of the player and the dealer. The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding it. If both the player and the dealer exceed 21, the dealer wins by default.

5. **Output:** Throughout the game, the program displays the current hands of the player and the dealer, as well as the sum of their card values. It also announces the winner at the end of each round.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this program is to provide a simple and interactive implementation of the Blackjack game. It allows users to play the game against a computer-controlled dealer and experience the excitement and strategy of the classic card game.

**Additional Considerations:**

- The program can be expanded with additional features such as betting, multiple players, and more sophisticated AI for the dealer.
- Error handling and input validation can be added to ensure robustness and prevent unexpected behavior.

Overall, this program offers a fun and engaging way for users to enjoy the timeless game of Blackjack on their computer.
